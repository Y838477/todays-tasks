# Todays Tasks

This application helps the user at keeping track of the tasks of the day.
More importantly, I use this application to learn bash scripting language and famous bash cmd.

## Installation

Download the files in your linux machine.
go to the user bin directory:

´´´bash
cd /usr/local/bin
´´´ 

then create a symlink to "todays-tasks" application:
´´´bash
ln -s ~/path/to/todays-tasks .
´´´

finally, make sure that "todays-tasks" is reachable from your global variable "$PATH":
´´´bash
tt -h
´´´

You should get a message that gives you more information on how to use the application.
